# Applications

The table below contains the list of application categories that are currently supported by webЯcade.

All items (games, etc.) that are "launched" (played, etc.) from webЯcade rely on the use of an associated *application*. For example, playing an SNES homebrew game utilizes the [Super Nintendo Application](../apps/emulators/snes/index.md) (emulator).

Clicking on the name of a *Category* in the table will navigate to a page containing the collection of applications within the category.

| __Category__ | __Description__ |

| [Engines](./engines/index.md) | The collection of game engines (ScummVM, Quake, etc.) supported by webЯcade |
