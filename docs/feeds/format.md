# Feed Format

This page details the [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (JavaScript Object Notation) format of a webЯcade feed along with a fully-formed [concrete example](#complete-example).

## Feed Object

The feed (root) object of a webЯcade feed includes high-level information about the feed, including a title, an optional description, and optional images. The feed object also includes a list of categories contained in the feed.

### Properties

The table below contains the properties available for the feed object.

| __Property__ | __Type__ | __Required__ | __Details__ |
|----------|------|----------|---------|
| title | String | Yes | A title for the feed. |
| longTitle | String | No | A long title for the feed (will be used in locations with additional room for display). |
| categories | Array of [Category](#category-object) objects | Yes | An array containing the categories associated with the feed (see [Category](#category-object) object).<br><br>The order that the categories appear in the array is identical to the order they will be presented in the [webЯcade player](../userguide/index.md) (they are not sorted).<br><br>A feed must contain at least one category. |
| description | String | No | A description of the feed. |
| thumbnail | URL | No | The location (URL) of a thumbnail image for the feed. |
| background | URL | No | The location (URL) of a background image for the feed. |
| props | Type-specific properties | No | Type-specific application properties that are global within the feed. For example, the [Atari Lynx Boot ROM](../apps/emulators/lynx/index.md#feed-properties) and [Neo Geo BIOS](../apps/emulators/neogeo/index.md#feed-properties) are specified within this set of properties.  |

### Example

The following is an example of a simple webЯcade feed with the feed object properties highlighted.

``` json hl_lines="1-7 25-28"

## Category Object

Category objects of a webЯcade feed provide a means of classifying items (games, etc.) into user-defined groups
(by game type, console type, etc.). Category objects include a title, associated images, and the items (games, etc.) that are included in the category.

For a feed to be considered valid it must contain at least one category object.

## Item Object

Item objects within a webЯcade feed correspond to items (games, etc.) that can be launched (played, etc.). Each item object must contain an application "`type`" property value (the specific emulator or game engine, etc. to launch). The [Applications](../apps/index.md) page contains a listing of all of the available applications. The detailed page for each application contains a *"Feed"* section that includes the application-specific `type` value. In addition to the application type, item objects may include a title, description, and associated images.

## Complete Example

The following is a complete example of a webЯcade feed that consists of two categories (Shooters and Puzzlers), wherein each category containing three items (games).

There is also a tab named, *"Shortened URLs*", wherein the links have been shortened (see [TinyURL page](./resources/tinyurl.md#shortened-urls)). Shortening of URLs is recommended as it reduces the size of the overall feed and mitigates false-positive blocking by simple URL filters.
